## Project Overview
Climate change is increasingly imposing economic and health burdens in Nigeria. Rising incidences of floods, heatwaves, and disease outbreaks affect **labour productivity** and **food security**.  

This study examines socioeconomic characteristics, health consultation patterns, food insecurity prevalence, and the economic consequences of climate-related health risks using robust regression and machine learning models. Analysis combines descriptive statistics, predictive modelling, and visualisation to inform policy and development interventions.

## Data Source & Methodology
- **Dataset:** Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) microdata on health, labour, and food security  
- **Sample:** 135 individuals; data cleaned and formatted in Excel  
- **Analysis:** Descriptive statistics | Logistic regression | Robust linear regression | Machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) | Development impact evaluation  
- **Variables:** Health costs, labour productivity, food insecurity, socioeconomic and regional factors  

---

## Tools
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboards with AI features for analysis of health costs and productivity  
- **Python** – Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib for regression, predictive modelling, and data visualisation  

---

## Research Objectives
1. Describe the socioeconomic characteristics of individuals affected by climate-induced health risks  
2. Examine health consultation patterns and insurance uptake  
3. Assess food insecurity prevalence and key determinants  
4. Model relationships between health costs, labour productivity, and socioeconomic factors

## Key Results

### Socioeconomic Characteristics
- Predominantly male (**78.52%**)  
- Mean age: 41.61 years  
- Household size: 5–6 members  
- Education levels vary, significant proportion with limited formal schooling  

### Health and Consultation Patterns
- Average hours worked: 198.87  
- Average absence due to illness: 0.98 days  
- Common illnesses: malaria, typhoid, headaches, ulcers  
- Low insurance coverage; most pay out-of-pocket  

### Food Insecurity and Influencing Factors
- Prevalence: 16.3% of individuals experienced food insecurity  
- Key variables examined: health costs, days off work, gender, sector, region  
- Logistic regression indicates no variable was statistically significant, reflecting complex and heterogeneous determinants  

### Regression & Predictive Modelling
- **Robust linear regression:** Age and sector significantly affect labour productivity  
- **Machine learning:** Random Forest (97.78% CV accuracy) and XGBoost (97.04% CV accuracy) identify income, food borrowing, and restricted consumption as top predictors

## Insights
- Climate-induced health risks reduce **labour productivity** and exacerbate **food insecurity**  
- Sector, age, and income are critical determinants of productivity and food security  
- Policy implications: targeted health interventions, social support, and food programmes for vulnerable populations  
- Geospatial and dashboard analyses highlight **regional disparities** and inform evidence-based planning
