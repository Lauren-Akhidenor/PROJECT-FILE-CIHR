## Project Overview
Climate change has substantial economic and health impacts in Nigeria. Increasing incidences of floods, heatwaves, and disease outbreaks affect both **labour productivity** and **food security**. This project investigates:  

1. Socioeconomic characteristics of individuals affected by climate-induced health risks.  
2. Health consultation patterns, insurance coverage, and disease prevalence.  
3. Food security status and its socioeconomic determinants.  
4. Relationships between health costs and labour productivity through **robust regression and machine learning models**.  

Data was extracted from **National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)**, cleaned in Excel, visualized with **Power BI and ArcGIS**, and analyzed using **Python**.

---

## Data Source & Methodology
- **Dataset:** NBS microdata on individual health, labour, and food security.  
- **Data Cleaning:** CSV â†’ Excel â†’ cleaned for missing values, formatting, and categorical consistency.  
- **Analysis Tools:** Power BI for dashboards, ArcGIS for geospatial mapping, Python for regression and predictive modeling.  
- **Sample Size:** 135 individuals.

---

## Tools
- **ArcGIS in Power BI** â€“ mapping disease prevalence and food insecurity across LGAs.  
- **Power BI** â€“ dashboards of socioeconomic characteristics, health costs, and food security indicators with **AI features**.  
- **Python** â€“ Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib.  

---

## Research Objectives
- Describe socioeconomic characteristics of individuals affected by climate-induced health risks.
