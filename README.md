## Project Overview
Climate change is increasingly imposing economic and health burdens in Nigeria. Rising incidences of floods, heatwaves, and disease outbreaks affect **labour productivity** and **food security**.  

This study examines socioeconomic characteristics, health consultation patterns, food insecurity prevalence, and the economic consequences of climate-related health risks using robust regression and machine learning models. Analysis combines descriptive statistics, predictive modelling, and visualisation to inform policy and development interventions.

---

## Data Source & Methodology
- **Dataset:** Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) microdata on health, labour, and food security  
- **Sample:** 135 individuals; data cleaned and formatted in Excel  
- **Analysis:** Descriptive statistics | Logistic regression | Robust linear regression | Machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost) | Development impact evaluation  
- **Variables:** Health costs, labour productivity, food insecurity, socioeconomic and regional factors  

---

## Tools
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboards with AI features for analysis of health costs and productivity  
- **Python** – Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib for regression, predictive modelling, and data visualisation  

---

## Research Objectives
1. Describe the socioeconomic characteristics of individuals affected by climate-induced health risks  
2. Examine health consultation patterns and insurance uptake  
3. Assess food insecurity prevalence and key determinants  
4. Model relationships between health costs, labour productivity, and socioeconomic factors

## Key Results

### Socioeconomic Characteristics
- Predominantly male (**78.52%**)  
- Mean age: 41.61 years  
- Household size: 5–6 members  
- Education levels vary, significant proportion with limited formal schooling  

### Health and Consultation Patterns
- Average hours worked: 198.87  
- Average absence due to illness: 0.98 days  
- Common illnesses: malaria, typhoid, headaches, ulcers  
- Low insurance coverage; most pay out-of-pocket  

### Food Insecurity and Influencing Factors
- Prevalence: 16.3% of individuals experienced food insecurity  
- Key variables examined: health costs, days off work, gender, sector, region  
- Logistic regression indicates no variable was statistically significant, reflecting complex and heterogeneous determinants  

### Regression & Predictive Modelling
- **Robust linear regression:** Age and sector significantly affect labour productivity  
- **Machine learning:** Random Forest (97.78% CV accuracy) and XGBoost (97.04% CV accuracy) identify income, food borrowing, and restricted consumption as top predictors

|-----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Sample           | 135 individuals         | Microdata for targeted interventions             |
| Food Insecurity  | 16.3% prevalence        | 1 in 6 households vulnerable                     |
| Avg Hours Worked | 198.87/month            | Productivity baseline to protect                 |
| Illness Absence  | 0.98 days avg           | Economic cost of climate-related health impacts  |
| ML Accuracy      | 97%+ (RF & XGBoost)    | Predictive targeting is possible                 |

## The Climate-Health-Productivity Nexus

Climate Events → Floods / Heatwaves → Disease Outbreaks (e.g. malaria, typhoid) → Increased Health Burden
→ Higher Out-of-Pocket Healthcare Costs → Lost Workdays / Reduced Labour Productivity → Household Income Loss → Food Insecurity → Coping Mechanisms (hunger, borrowing)


**Interpretation:**  
Climate shocks like floods and heat waves increase disease burden, driving **health expenditures, lost workdays, income reduction, and food insecurity**.  

---

## Critical Findings for Intervention Design

### Top ML Predictors of Vulnerability
- **Income level** – Primary determinant of household resilience  
- **Food borrowing** – Early warning signal for crisis  
- **Restricted consumption** – Indicator of imminent food insecurity  

### Significant Regression Findings
- **Age** significantly affects labour productivity  
- **Sector** significantly affects labour productivity  
- Food insecurity determinants are **multifactorial**, no single variable dominates

## Demographic Profile for Targeting

| Characteristic       | Finding                  | Targeting Implication                            |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Gender              | 78.52% male             | Don’t neglect 21.48% female-headed households |
| Age                 | Mean 41.61 years        | Working-age population is at risk              |
| Household Size      | 5–6 members             | High dependency ratios                          |
| Insurance Coverage  | Low                     | Out-of-pocket vulnerability                     |
| Common Illness      | Malaria, typhoid        | Preventable diseases dominate                   |

---

## Policy Implication  
- Target interventions using **income, borrowing behaviour, and consumption patterns** as early-warning indicators.  
- Focus on **working-age, high-dependency households**, and **female-headed households**. Preventive health measures for malaria and typhoid can improve productivity and reduce food insecurity.
