## üìò Project Overview
Climate change has substantial economic and health impacts in Nigeria. Increasing incidences of floods, heatwaves, and disease outbreaks affect both **labour productivity** and **food security**. This project investigates:  

1. Socioeconomic characteristics of individuals affected by climate-induced health risks.  
2. Health consultation patterns, insurance coverage, and disease prevalence.  
3. Food security status and its socioeconomic determinants.  
4. Relationships between health costs, labour productivity, and food insecurity through **robust regression and machine learning models**.  

Data was extracted from **National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)**, cleaned in Excel, visualized with **Power BI and ArcGIS**, and analyzed using **Python**.

---

## üìä Data Source & Methodology
- **Dataset:** NBS microdata on individual health, labour, and food security.  
- **Data Cleaning:** CSV ‚Üí Excel ‚Üí cleaned for missing values, formatting, and categorical consistency.  
- **Analysis Tools:** Power BI for dashboards, ArcGIS for geospatial mapping, Python for regression and predictive modeling.  
- **Sample Size:** 135 individuals.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools
- **ArcGIS in Power BI** ‚Äì mapping disease prevalence and food insecurity across LGAs.  
- **Power BI** ‚Äì dashboards of socioeconomic characteristics, health costs, and food security indicators.  
- **Python** ‚Äì Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib.  

---

## üéØ Research Objectives
- Describe socioeconomic characteristics of individuals affected by climate-induced health risks.  
- Examine health consultation patterns and insurance uptake.  
- Assess food security and identify key influencing factors.  
- Model the relationship between health costs, labour productivity, and food insecurity using regression and machine learning.

## üìä Results

### Objective 1: Socioeconomic Characteristics of Individuals
- **Gender:** 78.52% male, 21.48% female.  
- **Average Age:** 41.61 years.  
- **Average Household Size:** 5‚Äì6 members.  
- **Education:** Father and Mother‚Äôs education varied by zone, with significant proportions lacking formal education.  
- **Sectoral Distribution:** North vs South, urban vs rural (visualized in ArcGIS and Power BI).

---

### Objective 2: Health and Consultation Patterns
- **Average Hours Worked:** 198.87 hours.  
- **Average Absence Due to Illness:** 0.98 days.  
- **Common Illnesses:** Malaria, typhoid, body pains, headache, ulcer/stomach pain.  
- **Consultation Places:** Hospital, clinic, chemist, home.  
- **Insurance Coverage:** Very low uptake; most individuals pay out-of-pocket.  

---

### Objective 3: Food Security and Influencing Factors
- **Food Insecurity Prevalence:** 16.3% of individuals experienced food insecurity.  
- **Influencing Variables:** Monthly income, sector, zone, skipping meals, borrowing food.  
- **Key Observations:**  
  - Food insecurity more likely in **North Central** and **North East**.  
  - Lower income and inability to purchase food significantly increased food insecurity risk.

### Objective 4: Regression & Predictive Modeling

#### Robust Linear Model: Labour Productivity
| Predictor         | Coefficient | P-value | Interpretation                                         |
|------------------|------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Age               | -40.52     | 0.028   | Older individuals have lower productivity            |
| Sector_1          | -265.41    | 0.000   | Sectoral differences strongly affect productivity    |
| Other predictors  | NS         | >0.05   | Not statistically significant but relevant for policy|


#### Logistic Regression: Food Insecurity
- Pseudo R¬≤: 0.165  
- Predictors: Health cost, days stopped from work, gender, sector, zone.  
- Machine Learning Models:  
  - **Decision Tree:** 100% accuracy (small test set).  
  - **Random Forest:** 97.78% mean CV accuracy, top features: income, borrowing food, restricted consumption.  
  - **XGBoost:** 97.04% mean CV accuracy.
