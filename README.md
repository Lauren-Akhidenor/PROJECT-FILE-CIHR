# 🌍 Quantifying the Economic Burden of Climate-Induced Health Risks in Nigeria

> 🧪 *Analyzing how climate-related health shocks affect labour productivity and food security in Nigeria's agricultural households.*

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project evaluates the **economic burden of Climate-Induced Health Risks (CIHR)** across Nigeria using national survey data. It focuses on two key dimensions:

- 🌾 **Labour Productivity**: Impact of climate-induced health risks on agricultural output.
- 🥣 **Food Security**: Household food access amidst climate-health stressors.

## 📊 Key Findings 

## 🧍 Socio-Economic Characteristics

- 🧑‍🌾 **Gender**: 78.49% of respondents were male, indicating male-dominated agricultural households. Female household heads were more common in the South East.

- 🏡 **Sector**: 89.44% of respondents were from rural areas, highlighting high vulnerability to CIHR due to healthcare and infrastructure gaps.

- 📅 **Age**: The average age was 43.66 years. Majority were within the productive age bracket (18–47 years), linking to CIHR impact on labor force.

- 💍 **Marital Status**: 53% of respondents were married. Married households may face more pressure due to dependents, increasing CIHR susceptibility.

- 🎓 **Parental Education**: Over 50% of respondents’ parents had no formal education, potentially limiting their access to climate-health information.

- 💸 **Income**: The average income was ₦86,112/month, but the median was ₦25,000, indicating high income inequality and widespread poverty.

- 💼 **Employment**: a frequency of 433 respondents reported being unemployed, a critical factor increasing economic vulnerability to climate-health shocks.

- 🚑 **Access to Healthcare**: Average travel time to health facilities was 34.5 minutes. While most respondents spent <1 hour, up to 5 hours was recorded.

> 🔹 **Labour Productivity**:  
> CIHR has a **positive but statistically insignificant** effect (p = 0.741) on labour productivity.  
> This could be due to omitted socio-economic factors like access to healthcare.

-----

> 🔹 **Food Security**:  
> CIHR shows a **negative association** with food security (p = 0.164), suggesting increased health risks reduce access to food.

> 🔹 Additional Notes:
> - Gender and marital status were not significant.
> - Age negatively affected productivity (**p = 0.027**).
> - Women were 34.5% less likely to be food secure than men (**p = 0.049**).
> - Rural areas were 69% more likely to be food secure than urban.

These findings align with Akogun et al. (2021), who found sugarcane workers in Nasarawa State had increased productivity despite malaria, and Romanello et al. (2021), who noted food security vulnerability among climate-affected households.

## 💡 Recommendations 

To reduce CIHR and improve resilience:

- 🌱 **Adopt climate-resilient agricultural practices**
- 🛰️ **Integrate early warning systems and CIHR assessments** into policy
- 👩‍🌾 **Support gender-sensitive climate adaptation strategies**
- 🧮 **Link health and labor data** for future modeling
- 📈 **Strengthen health-labor-agriculture data collection** nationwide
